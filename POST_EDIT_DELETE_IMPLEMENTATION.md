# Post Edit and Delete Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented complete edit and delete functionality for posts in the dashboard, addressing the user's request for missing post management features.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Updated PostController (`server/controllers/postController.js`)
- **Added `updatePost` function**: Allows users to edit their own posts with proper ownership validation
- **Added `deletePost` function**: Allows users to delete their own posts with ownership verification
- **Added validation**: `updatePostValidation` for editing posts
- **Security**: Both functions check that the user owns the post before allowing modifications

### 2. Updated Routes (`server/routes/posts.js`)
- **Added PUT route**: `PUT /:id` for updating posts
- **Added DELETE route**: `DELETE /:id` for deleting posts
- Both routes are protected with `authenticateToken` middleware

## Frontend Implementation

### 3. Updated Post Service (`client/src/services/postService.js`)
- **Added `updatePost`**: Function to call the backend update API
- **Added `deletePost`**: Function to call the backend delete API

### 4. Enhanced PostCard Component (`client/src/components/PostCard.jsx`)
- **Added ownership detection**: Shows edit/delete menu only for post owners
- **Added dropdown menu**: Three-dot menu with edit and delete options
- **Added edit functionality**: 
  - Inline edit form with textarea
  - Update and Cancel buttons
  - Form validation and loading states
- **Added delete functionality**:
  - Confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Loading state during deletion
- **UI improvements**:
  - Hides like/comment actions during editing
  - Hides comments section during editing
  - Proper loading states and error handling

## Dashboard Membership Updates

### 5. Updated Dashboard (`client/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`)
- **Replaced "My Spaces"** with **"My Memberships"**
- **Added membership service integration**: Fetches user's subscriptions
- **Enhanced membership display**:
  - Shows membership plan names
  - Displays organization names
  - Shows membership status with color-coded indicators
  - Shows member numbers when available
- **Updated navigation**: "Browse All Spaces" → "Browse All Memberships"

### 6. Created Membership Service (`client/src/services/membershipService.js`)
- **Added `getUserMemberships`**: Fetches user's own subscriptions from `/api/membership/subscriptions/my`
- **Added other membership functions**: For browsing public plans and organizations

### 7. Updated Subscription Controller (`server/controllers/subscriptionController.js`)
- **Added `getUserSubscriptions`**: New endpoint to fetch user's own subscriptions
- **Added route**: `GET /membership/subscriptions/my` for user's subscriptions
- **Includes associated data**: Plan details and organization information

### 8. Database Seeding
- **Updated seed script**: Now creates sample subscriptions for testing
- **Sample data**: Created active subscription for admin user

5. Click "Delete" to remove the post (with confirmation)

### To Test Membership Dashboard:
