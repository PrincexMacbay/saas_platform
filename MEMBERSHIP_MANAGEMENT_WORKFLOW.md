## Business Logic Integration

### **Payment Processing Logic**
```javascript
// When a scheduled payment is due
if (scheduledPayment.status === 'pending' && scheduledPayment.scheduledDate <= now) {
  // Attempt payment processing
  const paymentResult = await processPayment(scheduledPayment);
  
  if (paymentResult.success) {
    await scheduledPayment.update({ status: 'processed' });
    await sendPaymentConfirmation(scheduledPayment.user);
  } else {
    await scheduledPayment.update({ status: 'failed' });
    await createDebt(scheduledPayment); // Automatic debt creation
    await sendPaymentFailureReminder(scheduledPayment.user);
  }
}
```

### **Debt Management Logic**
```javascript
// When a payment fails
async function createDebtFromFailedPayment(payment) {
  const debt = await Debt.create({
    amount: payment.amount,
    description: `Failed payment for ${payment.plan.name}`,
    dataType: 'subscription',
    userId: payment.userId,
    planId: payment.planId,
    subscriptionId: payment.subscriptionId,
    status: 'outstanding'
  });
  
  // Create overdue reminder
  await createReminder({
    name: 'Payment Overdue',
    type: 'overdue',
    reminderDate: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 1 day later
    message: `Your payment of $${payment.amount} is overdue. Please update your payment method.`,
    userId: payment.userId
  });
}
```

### **Reminder Processing Logic**
```javascript
// Process due reminders
async function processDueReminders() {
  const dueReminders = await Reminder.findAll({
    where: {
      status: 'pending',
      reminderDate: { [Op.lte]: new Date() }
    }
  });
  
  for (const reminder of dueReminders) {
    try {
      await sendEmail(reminder.user.email, reminder.message);
      await reminder.update({ status: 'sent' });
    } catch (error) {
      await reminder.update({ status: 'failed' });
    }
  }
}
```

### **Coupon Validation Logic**
```javascript
// Validate coupon for a specific plan and amount
async function validateCoupon(couponId, planId, amount) {
  const coupon = await Coupon.findOne({ where: { couponId } });
  
  if (!coupon || !coupon.isActive) {
    throw new Error('Invalid or inactive coupon');
  }
  
  if (coupon.expiryDate && new Date(coupon.expiryDate) < new Date()) {
    throw new Error('Coupon has expired');
  }
  
  if (coupon.maxRedemptions && coupon.currentRedemptions >= coupon.maxRedemptions) {
    throw new Error('Coupon usage limit reached');
  }
  
  // Calculate discount
  const discountAmount = coupon.discountType === 'percentage' 
    ? (amount * coupon.discount) / 100 
    : coupon.discount;
  
  return {
    coupon,
    discountAmount,
    finalAmount: Math.max(0, amount - discountAmount)
  };
}
```
