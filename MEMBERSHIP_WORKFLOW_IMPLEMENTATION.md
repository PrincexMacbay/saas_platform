# Membership Management Workflow Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of the membership management workflow, focusing on the Plans, Applications, Application Form, and Digital Card tabs. The system allows users to create custom application forms and link them to specific plans, with a complete flow from application submission to payment processing.

## üéØ Core Workflow

### 1. **Application Form Builder** (`/membership/application-form`)
- **Purpose**: Allows organization admins to create custom application forms
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop form builder
  - Multiple field types (text, textarea, select, checkbox, etc.)
  - Field validation and requirements
  - Form publishing/unpublishing
  - Organization-specific forms

### 2. **Plans Management** (`/membership/plans`)
- **Purpose**: Create and manage membership plans with custom application forms
- **Features**:
  - Plan creation with basic details (name, description, fee, benefits)
  - **Application Form Linking**: Each plan can be linked to a specific application form
  - Two options for form selection:
    - **Use Organization Default Form**: Uses the organization's published default form
    - **Use Custom Form**: Select a specific custom form for this plan
  - Plan activation/deactivation
  - Subscription tracking

### 3. **Application Submission Flow**
- **Public Plan Browsing**: Users can browse available plans
- **Application Form Display**: When applying for a plan, the system shows:
  - Organization's default form (if `useDefaultForm = true`)
  - Plan-specific custom form (if `useDefaultForm = false` and `applicationFormId` is set)
- **Form Submission**: Custom form data is captured and stored
- **Payment Processing**: After form submission, users are redirected to payment if required

### 4. **Applications Management** (`/membership/applications`)
- **Purpose**: Review and manage submitted applications
- **Features**:
  - View all applications with filtering and search
  - **Custom Form Data Display**: Shows all custom fields from the application form
  - Application approval/rejection with notes
  - Payment information display
  - User account creation upon approval

### 5. **Digital Card Management** (`/membership/digital-card`)
- **Purpose**: Generate and manage digital membership cards
- **Features**:
  - Card template customization
  - Plan-specific card designs
  - QR code generation for member verification
