# üöÄ **SAAS PLATFORM - SETUP INSTRUCTIONS**

## ‚ö° **QUICK START GUIDE (Docker - Recommended)**

The platform is **100% implemented** and ready to run. Here's how to complete the setup:

### **Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)**

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\saas_platform"

# Start development environment
.\start-dev.ps1
```

This single command will:
- Start PostgreSQL database
- Start backend with nodemon (auto-restart on changes)
- Start frontend with Vite (hot module replacement)
- Mount source code for live updates

**Access Points:**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000
- **Database**: localhost:5432

### **Option 2: Manual Setup (Without Docker)**

#### **Step 1: Database Setup**

Open a **new PowerShell terminal** in the server directory and run these commands **one by one**:

```powershell
# Navigate to server directory
cd "C:\saas_platform\server"

# Sync database (create all tables)
node scripts/sync-database.js

# Seed sample data
node scripts/seed-membership.js
```

If you get PowerShell errors, use **Command Prompt (cmd)** instead:

```cmd
cd "C:\saas_platform\server"
node scripts/sync-database.js
node scripts/seed-membership.js
```

#### **Step 2: Start Backend Server**

```powershell
# In server directory
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
üöÄ Server is running on port 5000
üìß Email service initialized
‚úÖ Database connected successfully
```

#### **Step 3: Start Frontend**

Open a **new terminal** in client directory:

```powershell
cd "C:\saas_platform\client"
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  Network: use --host to expose
```

### **Step 4: Test the Membership Module**

1. **Visit Public Membership Page**: 
   - Go to: http://localhost:5173/browse-memberships
   - You should see membership plans from sample organizations

2. **Login as Admin**:
   - Go to: http://localhost:5173/login
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

3. **Access Membership Dashboard**:
   - After login, click "Membership" in the navbar
   - You should see the admin dashboard with KPIs and charts

## üéØ **WHAT'S ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

### ‚úÖ **Backend (100% Complete)**
- **13 Database Models** with full relationships
- **Organization Support** (multi-tenant membership management)
- **Complete REST APIs** for all membership functions
- **Public APIs** for member browsing and applications
- **Email Notification System** with templates
- **Payment Processing Framework** (ready for Stripe/PayPal)
- **Admin Dashboard APIs** with analytics
- **User Role Management** (admin vs member)

### ‚úÖ **Frontend (100% Complete)**
- **Public Membership Browse Page** (`/browse-memberships`)
- **Admin Membership Dashboard** (`/membership/*`)
- **Plan Management UI** (create, edit, delete plans)
- **Application Review System** (approve/reject members)
- **Payment Tracking Interface** (view all payments)
- **Analytics Dashboard** (KPIs, charts, revenue tracking)
- **Settings Management** (configure membership options)
- **Responsive Design** (works on all devices)

### ‚úÖ **Key Features Working**
- **Multi-Organization Support** (Tech Innovators Hub, Creative Professionals Network)
- **5 Sample Membership Plans** (Developer, Senior Developer, Creative Basic, Creative Pro, Student)
- **Complete Member Workflow** (browse ‚Üí apply ‚Üí approve ‚Üí pay ‚Üí activate ‚Üí digital card)
- **Admin Management** (dashboard, analytics, member approval)
- **Public Access** (no login required to browse and apply)

## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Database Sync Fails:**
```powershell
# Force create Organization table first
node -e "const { Organization } = require('./models'); Organization.sync({ force: true }).then(() => console.log('‚úÖ Organization table created'))"

# Then sync all other tables
node -e "const { sequelize } = require('./models'); sequelize.sync({ alter: true }).then(() => console.log('‚úÖ All tables synced'))"
```

### **If Server Won't Start:**
1. Check if port 5000 is already in use
2. Make sure you're in the `server` directory
3. Verify `.env` file exists with database configuration

### **If Frontend Won't Connect:**
1. Ensure backend server is running on port 5000
2. Check if `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly in client
3. Verify no CORS issues in browser console
